The Hackable Clock
==================

A hackable alarm clock, made for experimentation to learn GPIO and programming.

Project page detailing out the hardware build is available at http://hackaday.io/project/3413-hack-ready-alarm-clock

Lessons and tutorials are coming soon.

Installation
------------

The hack-clock application is intended to be distributed as source, not in binary or packaged form, since
it is intended to be a teaching tool. Unfortunately this means we need to take a few extra steps to
install, but the entire process should take only a few minutes.

I'm assuming that you are starting with the Raspian Minimal Linux distribution. NOOBS or the like also works, but Raspian Minimal is small enough to fit on a 2GB microSD card. To install the hack-clock distribution on top of it:

1. Make sure your Raspberry Pi is up to date with the latest packages & firmware.
2. Enable I2C as described in Adafruit's tutorial at https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c
3. Add the necessary Python and GStreamer dependencies using `sudo apt-get install wiringpi python-setuptools python-pip python-dev python-dateutil python-smbus gstreamer0.10-x gstreamer-tools gstreamer0.10-plugins-base gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad python-gst0.10`
4. To let the pi user sense button presses, use the WiringPi GPIO Utility to permit non-root access to the pins. As an example: `gpio export 24 in; gpio mode 24 up`
5. Clone or download this repository using `git clone https://github.com/deckerego/hack-clock.git` or by downloading https://github.com/deckerego/hack-clock/archive/master.zip
6. Install hack-clock's dependencies using `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`. Note you MUST have `ntpdate` installed - pip doesn't like it when your system clock is wrong!
7. Copy the file `config.sample` to `config.py` and customize it for your environment (e.g. your local weather station)
8. Start the app by executing `./run_server.py` from within the hack-clock/webapp directory

Once the app starts, you should be able to get to the clock's web interface on port 9003. For example - http://192.168.1.2:9003/

Bear in mind you may want to consider forking the source instead of cloning the parent repository - that way you can make alterations and save your changes independently!

Starting the Clock at Boot
--------------------------

To start the clock as soon as your Raspberry Pi boots up:

1. Copy the startup script `hack-clock` into the directory `/etc/init.d`
2. Make sure the startup script is executable with `sudo chmod u+x /etc/init.d/hack-clock`
3. Ensure the clock starts at boot using the command `sudo update-rc.d hack-clock defaults`
4. Start the clock with `sudo service hack-clock start`

The start-up script also sets GPIO5 (Broadcom GPIO 24) with the correct input values and resistor states, so this is a helpful
way to make sure your button pins are set correctly.
