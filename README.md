The Hackable Clock
==================

A hackable alarm clock, made for experimentation to learn GPIO and programming.

Project page detailing out the hardware build is available at http://hackaday.io/project/3413-hack-ready-alarm-clock

Lessons and tutorials are coming soon.

Installation
------------

The hack-clock application is intended to be distributed as source, not in binary or packaged form, since
it is intended to be a teaching tool. Unfortunately this means we need to take a few extra steps to
install, but the entire process should take only a few minutes.

To install the hack-clock distribution:

1. Make sure your Raspberry Pi is up to date with the latest packages & firmware.
2. Enable I2C as described in Adafruit's tutorial at https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c
3. Ensure the pi user is added to the i2c group in /etc/group - there should be a line at the bottom of the file that looks like `i2c:x:110:pi`
4. Install WiringPi as described within http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/
5. To let the pi user sense button presses, use the WiringPi GPIO Utility to permit non-root access to the pins. As an example: `gpio export 24 in; gpio mode 24 up`
6. Add the necessary Python tools using `sudo apt-get install python-distribute python-dev python-smbus`
7. Install the Pip dependency manager using `sudo easy_install pip`
8. Clone or download this repository using `git clone https://github.com/deckerego/hack-clock.git`
9. Install hack-clock's dependencies using `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`
10. Copy the file `config.sample` to `config.py` and customize it for your environment (e.g. your local weather station)
11. Start the app by executing `./run_clock.py` from within the hack-clock directory

Bear in mind you may want to consider forking the source instead of cloning the parent repository -
that way you can make alterations and save your changes independently!

Starting the Clock at Boot
--------------------------

To start the clock as soon as your Raspberry Pi boots up:

1. Copy the startup script `hack-clock` into the directory `/etc/init.d`
2. Ensure the clock starts at boot using the command `sudo update-rc.d hack-clock defaults`
3. Start the clock with `sudo service hack-clock start`
