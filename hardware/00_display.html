  <h1>Connecting the 7-Segment LED Display</h1>

  <p>
    The LED display and the "backpack" logic board ships in two separate pieces from Adafruit -
    follow the instructions at https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-backpack/1-2-inch-7-segment-backpack
    to solder the pieces together. Don't worry about the "Seven-Segment Backpack Firmware"
    section - at this point we just need to solder the pins correctly and connect the wires
    to our Raspberry Pi.
  </p>

  <p>
    To wire up the LED display to the Raspberry Pi you need to grab a five jumper wires of varying colors.
    The actual color doesn't matter at all... however sometimes it is helpful to stick with a color scheme.
    By using the same colors each time, you can more easily determine what each wire is supposed to do.

  <h2>To wire up the Adafruit 7-Segment LED backpack to a Raspberry Pi:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Wire the VIO (I/O power) pin on the display to Pin #1 (3.3V power) on the Raspberry Pi using a grey jumper cable</li>
    <li>Connect the SDA (I2C Data) pin on the display to Pin #3 (SDA) on the Raspberry Pi using a red cable</li>
    <li>Connect the SCL (I2C Clock) pin on the display to Pin #5 (SCL) on the Raspberry Pi with a blue cable</li>
    <li>Wire the GND (Ground) pin on the display to Pin #7 (Ground) on the Raspberry Pi using a black jumper cable</li>
    <li>Connect the VDC (LED power) pin on the display to Pin #2 (5V power) on the Raspberry Pi with a white jumper cable</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Once the display is wired up, double-check your connections and power on your Raspberry Pi. If you have loaded
    <a href="https://github.com/deckerego/hack-clock/tree/lesson_one">Lesson One</a> of the Hack Clock on the Pi,
    you should see a lit-up display with three 0's!
