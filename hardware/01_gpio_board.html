  <h1>Creating Buttons and Switches</h1>

  <p>
    The GPIO board is a bit different than the display and the audio amp...
    it is not a ready-made breakout board, but instead one we need to assemble.
    We need the following parts (also listed in the
    <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/413935">Hack Clock's v2 Wishlist</a>):
    <ul>
      <li>A <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12043">mini breadboard</a></li>
      <li>A few <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10302">push buttons</a></li>
      <li>One or two <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10213">N-channel MOSFETs</a> (or a relay switch)</li>
      <li>
        A <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10969">4.7k resistor</a> for each MOSFET
        (probably won't need this for a relay)</a>
      </li>
      <li>Some short lengths of insulated wire</li>
    </ul>

    If you don't have a good stock of random resistors around, I would recommend ordering
    Sparkfun's <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10969">resistor kit</a>. It will
    save you on future projects!

  <h2>Input (Buttons)</h2>

  <p>
    Let's wire up some buttons. The buttons will connect a general purpose
    input/output (GPIO) pin to a ground pin. Once the GPIO pin is connected to ground,
    our alarm clock will notice a button has been pressed and react likewise.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, let's push our button onto the mini breadboard. This button should act
    as a bridge over the middle, empty space within our breadboard. One half of this
    breadboard is not electrically connected to the other half... unless we use a
    button or a wire as a bridge. When the button is pressed into the breadboard,
    all the pins on one side should be on one half of the breadboard:

  <p>
    Next, let's connect GPIO pin #23 to our mini breadboard using a jumper wire.
    This will connect a pin on the button to a pin on the Raspberry Pi.
    Connect your jumper wire to the XXth pin on the right side of the Raspberry Pi's row of GPIO pins:

  <p>
    Finally, to complete this button's circuit we need to connect the other pin on
    the button to a ground pin on the Raspberry Pi. Let's pick the closest ground
    pin to the GPIO pin we just used:

  <p>
    Let's add a second button as well. Note that we can have all of our buttons and
    switches share the <i>same</i> ground pin, which cuts down on the number of wires
    going back and forth. We will add some short wire to our mini breadboard
    to connect our new button to ground, and then will wire the new button to
    GPIO pin #24:

  <h2>Output (Switches)</h2>

  <p>
    Now that we've wired up a few buttons, let's connect a switch that we can turn
    on or off.
