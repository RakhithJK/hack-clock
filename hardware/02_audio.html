  <h1>Wiring Up the Audio Amplifier &amp; Speakers</h1>

  <p>
    An alarm clock isn't much of an alarm clock if it doesn't have a shrill little
    scream to wake you up. On this step we will wire up a digital audio decoder,
    amplifier and a 2-channel mono speaker.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will notice on Model A's and Model B's of the Raspberry Pi there is a headphone
    jack that you could possibly amplify and drive a speaker with. The first attempt
    wired a TTRS jack to a small amplifier, and then drove a small mono speaker.
    The headphone jacks were cumbersome, required some careful soldering skills,
    and the sound interface wasn't that reliable. Some times the audio alarm just wouldn't power up!
  </p>

  <p>
    With this build of the Hack Clock we are using digital audio output from the
    Raspberry Pi, following the Inter-IC Sound Bus (I2S) standard. Adafruit sells
    a very efficient
    <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/3006">I2S decoder and amplifier</a>
    in one tiny package based on the MAX98357A chip. This actually reduces the part
    count, is cheaper and so far is more reliable!
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's connect the speaker first. I use small speakers (either 4Ω or 8Ω)
    like you would find in a toy or a greeting card. Those tiny speakers
    can't drive too much sound before they clip out &amp; issue nothing but static,
    so it helps to have a speaker housing for them.

  <p>
    My favorite cheap speaker housing is a plastic cap from a milk or orange
    juice bottle. After drilling a couple of small holes in the side and using some
    double-sided tape, I inserted the speaker into the cap and thread the wires through
    the holes. Now we can get louder!

  <p>
    Next, we can screw the speaker wires into the screw-in terminals on the Adafruit
    breakout board. The order of the wires doesn't really matter since we are using
    a single speaker.

  <p>
    After this we need to provide power and data to our MAX98357A breakout board.
    Unfortunately the wiring from the board to the Raspberry Pi pins isn't nice
    and organized - it spreads across the board.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's connect with:
    <ol>
      <li>Connect the Vin pin on the amp to the +5V pin (pin #2) on the Raspberry Pi</li>
      <li>Connect the GND pin on the amp to the Ground pin (pin #39) on the Pi</li>
      <li>Connect the  to the  on the Pi</li>
      <li>Connect the  to the  on the Pi</li>
      <li>Connect the  to the  on the Pi</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    Phew. Done! If we load up <a href="/lessons/">Lesson 4: Play Music</a>,
    <i>or</i> if we SSH into the Raspberry Pi and execute <code>speakertest -c 2 -i 3</code>,
    we should be able to hear some sound! The Hack Clock ships with a test audio
    track so you can try things out.

    Finally, the best part - <a href="03_enclosure.html">building your enclosure</a>!
