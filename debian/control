Description: A hackable alarm clock for the Raspberry Pi
 The Hackable Clock
 ==================
 .
 A hackable alarm clock, made for experimentation in order to build programming skills as well as the basics of circuit building.
 .
 Lessons and tutorials are currently a work-in-progress, however drafts are available at http://hackclock.deckerego.net/
 .
 .
 Building the Hardware
 ---------------------
 .
 Step-by-step instructions for creating your clock are available at http://hackaday.io/project/3413-hack-ready-alarm-clock
 .
 A suggested list of hardware you might need to buy is saved as a wishlist at Adafruit: https://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/413935
 .
 Installation
 ------------
 .
 I'm assuming that you are starting with the Raspian Minimal Linux distribution. NOOBS or the like also works, but Raspian Minimal is small enough to fit on a 2GB microSD card. To install the hack-clock distribution on top of it:
