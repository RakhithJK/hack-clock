  <h1>Reporting Issues</h1>

  <p>
    If you have any issues with the Hack Clock, or find an error in the documentation,
    or just need something clarified - feel free to send me a message on my
    <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/3413-hack-ready-alarm-clock#j-discussions-title">
    Hackaday Project message board</a> - I'll respond as soon as I see it.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you found a bug or identified a place in the Hack Clock libraries that doesn't
    quite work, go ahead and open a case on the
    <a href="https://github.com/deckerego/hack-clock/issues">Hack Clock Issues Board</a>,
    along with steps to reproduce the bug. I'll keep that issue up-to-date and let
    you know when it closes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks for letting me know what you find!
