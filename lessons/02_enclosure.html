  <h1>Lesson Two: Building the Enclosure</h1>

  <p>
    The enclosure that is meant to keep and protect your clock can be anything. You can build it from
    a cardboard box, a bunch of Lego, an old wallet box - whatever you like! Just make sure you have enough room
    for your Raspberry Pi, the LED display and a few wires.
  </p>

  <p>
    One easy, protective measure to avoid shorting out your Raspberry Pi is to cover the bottom section of the board
    with masking tape. This helps to avoid accidentally touching the metal pins underneath the board with other metal
    pieces, which may damage your Raspberry Pi.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once your enclosure is done, start up your Hack Clock and make sure everything is working!
