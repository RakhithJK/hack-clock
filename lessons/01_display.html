  <h1>Lesson One: Connecting the 7-Segment LED Display</h1>

  <p>
    To wire up the LED display to the Raspberry Pi you need to grab a five jumper wires of varying colors. The actual color doesn't matter at all...
    however sometimes it is helpful to stick with a color scheme that other engineers often use. By using the same colors each time, you can more
    easily determine what each wire is supposed to do.

  <h2>To wire up the Adafruit 7-Segment LED backpack to a Raspberry Pi:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Wire the VIO (I/O power) pin on the display to Pin #1 (3.3V power) on the Raspberry Pi using a grey jumper cable</li>
    <li>Connect the SDA (I2C Data) pin on the display to Pin #3 (SDA) on the Raspberry Pi using a red cable</li>
    <li>Connect the SCL (I2C Clock) pin on the display to Pin #5 (SCL) on the Raspberry Pi with a blue cable</li>
    <li>Wire the GND (Ground) pin on the display to Pin #7 (Ground) on the Raspberry Pi using a black jumper cable</li>
    <li>Connect the VDC (LED power) pin on the display to Pin #2 (5V power) on the Raspberry Pi with a white jumper cable</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Once the display is wired up, double-check your connections and power on your Raspberry Pi. If you have loaded
    <a href="https://github.com/deckerego/hack-clock/tree/lesson_one">Lesson One</a> of the Hack Clock on the Pi,
    you should see a lit-up display with three 0's!
