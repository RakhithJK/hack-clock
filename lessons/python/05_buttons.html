  <h1>Lesson Five: Adding Buttons to Push</h1>

  <p>
    Up to now the only way for us to interact with our clock has been through
    its web page and IDE. What if we aren't near our computers? Let's add a
    button on our Hack Clock so it can respond to us pressing it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before we keep going you need a button wired up to your Raspberry Pi, as detailed in the
    <a href="/hardware/01_gpio_board.html">Creating Buttons and Switches</a>
    section of the hardware instructions. We will be programming your clock to
    respond to pressing your clock's button down.
