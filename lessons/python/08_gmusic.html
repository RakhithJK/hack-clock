  <h1>Waking up with Google Music</h1>

  <p>
    If you use Google Music, you can play the "I'm Feeling Lucky" radio station
    when you wake up!
  </p>

  <p>
    To enable the Google Music block within your toolbox, you will need to
    provide your Google username and password (or application password if you use
    two-factor authentication) to the Hack Clock configuration file
    <code>/etc/hack-clock.conf</code> as in:
  </p>

  <code>
        "google_username": "chuckles_mcharty",
        "google_password": "yohohothisisntmypassword",
  </code>

  <p>
    Restart the hack-clock service and then you can use the following code
    to launch the radio station:
  </p>

  <code>
    from hackclock.runapp.Libs.GStreamer import Speaker
    from hackclock.runapp.Libs.GoogleMusic import AudioStream

    speaker = Speaker()
    speaker.playList(AudioStream())
  </code>
