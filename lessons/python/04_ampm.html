  <h1>Lesson Four: Conditional Logic</h1>

  <p>
    Right now we are essentially showing the hours in "military time," using a
    whole number between 0 and 23. Some people would rather use the AM/PM indicator
    instead, using whole numbers between 1 and 12 then lighting an LED up to indicate
    if the time relates to the evening hours or the morning hours.
  </p>

    <p>
      Essentially we want to tell our clock that if the "hours" variable is less than 12,
      we need to keep the evening indicator light off. If the variable is greater
      than or equal to 12, we need to light the evening indicator. This kind of either/or logic
      is considered "conditional logic" when programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      Python, like a lot of languages, uses the keywords "if" and "else"
      to indicate <i>if</i> something is true, execute some code, <i>else</i>
      execute a different section of code. You can expand this logic to do something
      if a variable or condition is <i>not</i> true as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this lesson we will change our code from <a href="02_showthetime.html">Lesson 2</a>
      only slightly, introducing a new variable called "is_evening" that is True if
      the hours are greater than 12.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now have created our own variable that knows if it is current the evening
      or not. If we are <i>not</i> in the evening, we assume we are currently in the
      morning hours. Right after we define the variable "now," let's define "is_evening:"
    </p>

    <pre>
# Show the current time
def showCurrentTime():
    now = datetime.now()

    # Set the hours
    is_evening = now.hour > 12
    </pre>

    <p>
      Now let's use this new knowledge to tell the clock to display the current hour
      <i>if</i> it is <i>not</i> the evening, <i>else</i> <u>subtract</u> twelve hours
      from the current hour.
    </p>

    <pre>
# Show the current time
def showCurrentTime():
    now = datetime.now()

    # Set the hours
    is_evening = now.hour > 12
    display.setHours(now.hour if not is_evening else now.hour - 12)
    </pre>

    <p>
      Now we no longer show things in military time! We still need a way to indicate
      if it's the morning or the evening however. Luckily this is easy - we don't
      even need to use conditional logic!
    </p>

    <pre>
# Show the current time
def showCurrentTime():
    now = datetime.now()

    # Set the hours
    is_evening = now.hour > 12
    display.setHours(now.hour if not is_evening else now.hour - 12)

    # Set the indicator lights
    display.setColon(True)
    display.setEvening(is_evening)
    </pre>

    <p>
      Essentially what we are doing here is saying the evening indicator should be
      <u>the same value</u> as "is_evening," which is always either True or False.
      If "is_evening" is true, "setColon()" is true as well!
    </p>

    <p>
      We have now covered functions, variables, constructors and conditional logic.
      Those concepts will carry us through to our next lesson!
