  <h1>Initial Setup for Instructors</h1>
  <p>
    Before students begin working on the Hack Clock, some prep does need to be done to get the working environment ready.
  </p>

  <p>
    First off, you'll need all the right ingredients. The parts list is available at http://hackaday.io/project/3413-hack-ready-alarm-clock and
    includes some links to buy the pieces online. Some parts may be salvaged from old projects or other consumer electronics you have lying around.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once your parts arrive you'll need to prep your Raspberry Pi. The Hack Clock software was tested using the NOOBS
    Debian OS distribution, however it is pretty likely that the software will work on other Linux Raspberry Pi
    distributions. Make sure you have connected your Pi to your home network, since code editing will happen via
    a web interface.
  </p>

  <p>
    It can be helpful to color code the pins on the Raspberry Pi and the Adafruit 7-Segment display backpack. I've used poster paints
    in simple, primary colors with matching jumper wires to help students match pins together and quickly trace back errors.

  </p>

  <p>
    Once the Pi is prepped, install the Hack Clock software using the instructions listed at https://github.com/deckerego/hack-clock .
    Usually it is best to have the web application automatically start when the Raspberry Pi boots up. If you'd like to start with the
    bare-bones features in Lesson One, checkout the `lesson_one` branch.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the code is installed and the Pi has started up, find out what your hosname is or your IP address is. Verify you can see
    the Hack Clock's web page by visiting http://YourHostName:9003/, where "YourHostName" is actually the hostname or IP address
    of the Raspberry Pi that you will be using. Bookmark or write down this URL - your students will need to refer to it often.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hopefully that's it! If you have any issues, tickets can be opened at https://github.com/deckerego/hack-clock/issues which I'll
    check on occasion. After the setup is complete you can have your students (or yourself) <a href="/lessons/01_display.html">connect to the display</a>!
