  <h1>Lesson Five: Adding Buttons to Push</h1>

    <p>
      Up to now the only way for us to interact with our clock has been through
      its web page and IDE. What if we aren't near our computers? Let's add a
      button on our Hack Clock so it can respond to us pressing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we keep going you need a button wired up to your Raspberry Pi, as detailed in the
      <a href="/hardware/01_gpio_board.html">Creating Buttons and Switches</a>
      section of the hardware instructions. We will be programming your clock to
      respond to pressing your clock's button down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually we will want this button to display the temperature outside, but
      before we do that let's write a simple test that will cause your display to show
      only zeros for a while. First up: we will write a function that zero's out your display.
      Let's name it "switchWeatherStations" since it will <i>eventually</i> show the
      weather.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this function is turning off all of our display indicators and only showing
      "0" for the minute and hour. The very end of this function has an interesting block
      from the "Time" drawer - the "Wait for _ seconds" action. This will make your code
      wait for a few seconds, and then continue updating the time as it always has.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now let's call this function once we press our button. If you open up the
      "Buttons &amp; Switches" drawer in our toolbox, you will see several constants
      for whatever buttons and switches were set up when the Hack Clock software
      was installed. Each button and switch has its own unique number. This unique
      number is the <i>input/output number</i> that the Raspberry Pi knows. While
      this may be the first button on your clock, it may be the 24th input/output
      number on the Raspberry Pi. If this seems weird... it kinda is. If you have
      problems finding out what number your button is, ask whomever installed the
      button if possible. Otherwise you can just guess and try again - you aren't
      going to hurt anything by experimenting in your code!
    </p>

    <p>
      Another interesting block is the "When I press _" action. Let's drag that over
      to our workspace, and click "Button #24" onto the top:
    </p>

    <img src="/images/05_buttons/blocks_onpress.png" alt="Building the 'When I press' call"/>

    <p>
      Now we need to inject our new "switchWeatherStations" function into the
      "When I press" action:
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's save our work now. Once your new code is finished saving, when you press
      the button it should zero-out the display. If your button does not work, there
      is an even <i>simpler</i> test you can load to see if the problem is with the
      code or with the wires connecting the button. Go to the "Restore" page
      and load the "Using switches and buttons" example. That should dim and
      then brighten your display when a button is pressed. If that code doesn't
      work correctly, check with the person who put your Raspberry Pi together
      and have them check the button connected to the clock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nicely done! Now that the button works, let's get it to
      <a href="06_temperature.html">show the current temperature outside</a>!
    </p>
