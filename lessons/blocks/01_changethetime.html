  <h1>Lesson One: Change the Time</h1>

  <p>
    We've wired up the display and so far all we see is... "0:0." Exciting.
  </p>

  <p>
    What we want to see is the current time. Open up the Hack Clock IDE again,
    and take a look at the code we loaded for Lesson One.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have a lot of oddly-shaped rectangles and puzzle pieces connected here.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reading from top to bottom, we can see that we are telling the display to turn on
    the colon lights, turn off the evening indicator ("set(False)" means turn it off),
    set the hours digits to "0," set the minutes digits to "0" and set the brightness
    level to "1."
  </p>

  <p>
    Now let's change the minutes and hours digits that are showing on the display.
    Change the hours to "12":
    <pre>display.setHours(12)</pre>
    and set the minutes to "33":
    <pre>display.setMinutes(33)</pre>
    After that is changed in your code, click on the save button in the top-right
    corner: <img id="save" src="/lessons/01_changethetime/save.png" alt="Save Button"/>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you save your changes, the clock should re-start itself. The display will blink,
    and you should see it now display "12:33." Congratulations! You can now make
    the display show whatever you wish!
  </p>

  <p>
    Next up - try adjusting the brightness. Set it to the highest value of 15, and the
    lowest value of 0. Set it for a few values in between. What level of brightness
    do you like most?
