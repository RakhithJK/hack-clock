  <h1>Lesson One: Change the Time</h1>

  <p>
    We've wired up the display and so far all we see is... "0:0." Exciting.
  </p>

  <p>
    What we want to see is the current time. Open up the Hack Clock IDE again,
    and take a look at the code we loaded for Lesson One.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have a lot of oddly-shaped rectangles and puzzle pieces connected here. Let's make
    sense of it all. First off, the toolbox:
  </p>

  <img src="/images/01_changethetime/blocks_toolbox.jpg" alt="The IDE's toolbox" />

  <p>
    The toolbox is on the left edge of our integrated development environment, or IDE.
    From here we can open a drawer in our toolchest, pick a block to use, and then
    drag it over to the workspace. Click on the "Display" label on the toolbox - you
    will see a set of blocks appear just to the right of that list. Try to drag a block
    from the toolbox onto the plain white workspace - you should be able to
    drag-and-drop it anywhere there is free space. The block should click into place.
    After that, drag the block into the trash icon in the bottom-right. The block
    should dissapear.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each block represents either an "action," a "value," or a "variable."
    Let's look at "actions" first.
  </p>

  <p>
    Actions usually connect to a value or a variable, but they don't necessarily need to.
    Each action does something useful - such as make a number light on the display
    or play some music. Actions can also be connected to other actions from the top
    or bottom, so that actions can execute in a sequence. If an action is snapped on
    top of another action, the top action will execute and then the bottom action will
    execute next.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's look at values next:
  </p>

  <img src="/images/01_changethetime/blocks_values.jpg" alt="Values within our blocks IDE"/>

  <p>
    Values are like set-in-stone facts about our world. The number "0" is always zero,
    the letter "B" is always a capital b. I can't force a "0" to be equal to one - it
    is always the same. Here you can see values highlighted like numbers or brightness.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you look at the Lesson 1 code, reading from top to bottom, we can see that
    a stack of actions are telling the display to turn on the colon lights,
    turn off the evening indicator, set the hours digits to "0," set the minutes
    digits to "0" and set the brightness level to "normal."
  </p>

  <p>
    What does the little block named "LED Display" do? Right now let's think of
    it like a value, since we can't change the meaning of it. This will always
    operate the light-up display.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now let's change the minutes and hours digits that are showing on the display.
    Change the hours to "12" and set the minutes to "33", then click on the save button in
    the top-right corner: <img id="save" src="/images/00_lightup/save.png" class="icon" alt="Save Button"/>.
  </p>

  <img src="/images/01_changethetime/blocks_newnumbers.png" alt="Values within our blocks IDE"/>

  <p>
    Once you save your changes, the clock should re-start itself. The display will blink,
    and you should see it now display "12:33." Congratulations! You can now make
    the display show whatever you wish!
  </p>

  <p>
    Next up - try adjusting the brightness. Set it to the highest value of "brightest", and the
    lowest value of "off." Set it for a few values in between. What level of brightness
    do you like most?
