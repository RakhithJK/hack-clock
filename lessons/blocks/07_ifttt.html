  <h1>"Internet of Things" Automation with IFTTT</h1>

  <p>
    The Hack Clock can integrate with the automation service
    <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT.com</a> to turn your lights on
    when your alarm goes off, send out a tweet at the press of a button,
    or fire up your coffee maker at a given time.
  </p>

  <p>
    To turn on IFTTT within your toolbox, you will need to use the
    <a href="https://ifttt.com/services/maker_webhooks/settings">Maker service</a>
    within IFTTT and have it generate a new webhook key for you. Once you do,
    add it to <code>/etc/hack-clock.conf</code> as in:
  </p>

  <code>
        "ifttt_maker_key": "sdfafd_aDAKDF_wadfs",
  </code>

  <p>
    Once you have changed your config file, re-start the hack-clock service
    to read in the new file. After the restart, you should see the following
    new block in your toolbox:
  </p>

  <p>
    This new block allows you to send an "event" message to an IFTTT applet,
    which in turn can work with an IFTTT integration to cause something to happen.
    As an example, here is how you can configure an IFTTT applet that switches on
    an LIFX light on once your alarm sounds:
