  <h1>Lesson Six: Show the Temperature Outside</h1>

  <p>
    Now we will code something really cool (or hot) - reaching out to the Internet
    and finding out what the temperature is outside!
  </p>

  <p>
    Your Raspberry Pi should be able to connect to the Internet for this lesson
    to work correctly. If it does, when we press a button the clock should reach
    out to the <a href="http://www.weather.gov/">US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>
    and use the <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/stations.php">weather station</a>
    closest to you to find the current temperature outside. Once your clock finds out
    what the temperature is, it will show it on your display for a few seconds.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the <a href="05_buttons.html">previous lesson</a> we tested our button out
    but we didn't want to fetch the weather yet - we made our test as simple
    as possible before we added something new. Now we can open up the "Weather"
    drawer in our toolbox:
  </p>

  <img src="/images/06_temperature/blocks_toolbox.png" alt="The Weather drawer" />

  <p>
    We have only two blocks in this drawer, and we will use both of them to add
    a new action into our "switchWeatherStations" function:
  </p>

  <img src="/images/06_temperature/blocks_getweather.png" alt="Get the current weather"/>

  <p>
    Save our work and now test this out. You should see the current weather on your
    clock! If things do not work, test to make sure:
    <ol>
      <li>Your button is plugged into your Raspberry Pi correctly</li>
      <li>Your Raspberry Pi can connect to the Internet</li>
      <li>Your local weather station is correctly configured</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    Congratulations - you're the proud builder of a fully operational Hack Clock!
    You aren't finished yet - you can now customize the Hack Clock in whatever way
    you like. If you would like to see some other examples (like having a button
    control the music), click on the "Restore" button and load one of the examples.
    Don't worry too much about messing up; you can restore your previously saved
    code if things go completely wrong!
