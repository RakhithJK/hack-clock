  <p>
    Kids, teens and adults are more inspired to tinker after they learn the basic framework of what they are tinkering with. Electronics and circuit sets are great, but it really helps to jump-start learning with demos or projects that are heavily documented in the box. After you get your bearings on what works and what breaks, you are more free to experiment and add your own ideas.

  <p>
    To that effort I'm working on a hackable alarm clock based on the Raspberry Pi platform along with several Adafruit/Sparkfun components. The idea is that we can build a customized, tricked-out bedroom alarm clock with some general off-the-shelf components to see how hardware and software work in concert to create something useful. After the project is done, I'm hoping its creators will feel inspired to rip it apart or build new features using the pieces.

  <h3>How to Build</h3>
  <p>
    Initial build steps will be provided on the <a href="http://hackaday.io/project/3413-hack-ready-alarm-clock">HackADay Project Page</a>, to be replaced by upcoming lesson plans.
  </p>

  <h3>Lessons</h3>
  <p>
    Lesson plan writing is underway! The current outline is:
    <ol>
      <li>Build the enclosure, wire up I2C, light up the digits with 0â€™s</li>
      <li>Set the brightness, light the colon, create a loop, blink the colon</li>
      <li>Get the current datetime, set 24 hour + minutes</li>
      <li>Enable AM/PM functionality</li>
      <li>Add in weather station</li>
      <li>Create a button, wire it in, make it blink the display</li>
      <li>Have the button switch in between weather and time</li>
      <li>Wire up a speaker, test using aplay, scp a music file</li>
      <li>Play song at a specified time, stop at button press</li>
      <li>Automatic dimmer (analog vs. digital pins)</li>
    </ol>
