A hackable alarm clock, built for experimentation and learning. The Hack Clock
helps you learn both the construction of basic electronics as well as some basic
programming concepts.

The Hack Clock uses cheap and readily available hardware, leveraging the
<a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> platform as well as simple
breakout boards from <a href="http://adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>. Add buttons, music,
switches - whatever you like to customize your clock.

Project page detailing out the hardware build is available at [http://hackaday.io/project/3413-hack-ready-alarm-clock](http://hackaday.io/project/3413-hack-ready-alarm-clock).

The Hack Clock software is open source and available at
